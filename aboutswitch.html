Qrgui has moved&#151;to Savannah!
</p>

<p>
In the interest of using network services that are free as in freedom, meaning
their source is available to its users under a freedom respecting license, I
have decided to move all development of Qrgui to Savannah, the software forge run by the
Free Software Foundation. (Savannah's source is, in fact, publicly available
and under a free license.)<br />
&#151;The Mgt.
</p>

Qrgui's new home is at:<br />
<strong>https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/qrgui</strong>
