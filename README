Qrgui has moved--to Savannah!
In the interest of using network services that are free as in freedom, meaning
their source is available to its users under a freedom respecting license, I
have decided to move all development to Savannah, the software forge run by the
Free Software Foundation. (Savannah's source is, in fact, publicly available
and under a free license.)

Qrgui's new home: <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/qrgui>

ABOUT QRGUI
===========
Qrgui is a minimalistic GUI-based wrapper for qrencode, a command line based QR code generator.

What does that mean?
    You can generate QR codes without using the command line.

Qrgui is free software, released under the GNU General Public License (See the
LICENSE file for more details.)
